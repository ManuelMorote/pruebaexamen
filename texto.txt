Game Over, The One Nobody Wants (Nobody Wants)
Take Over, He Will Not Admit Defeat (Admit Defeat)
 
Taking Fight, Heated As Hell!
From Whom We Celebrate, Welcome Ichiban!
Go Forth And Lead The Wonderful Life! Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah!
 
Why? Does It Always Seen Fall Apart?
So Close, Yet So Far
Dreaming Of His Death, Yet Feels No Hate,
Just A Single Stray Dog
 
Never Been Anywhere But Down,
At Rock Bottom Since A Kid
With Only The Big City To, Towards A Bleak,12
Meaningless Future
 
Taking Fight, Heated As Hell!
From Whom We Celebrate, Welcome Ichiban!
Go Forth And Lead The Wonderful Life! Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah!
 
No One Speaks A Word, Nothing But Silence
Broken Nerves On A Shaky See-Saw,
Swaying Between Liquor And Narcotics
 
Kasuga Ichiban Will Take Them Down!
Justice Will Sometimes Be Ruthless!
Blade In Hand, Facing Pain And Hardship,
He Cuts Through This New Era!
 
Taking Fight, Heated As Hell!
From Whom We Celebrate, Welcome Ichiban!
Go Forth And Lead The Wonderful Life! Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah!
 
(We Celebrate! We Celebrate! Let's Go!)
 
A Life Dyed By The Color Of Dispair,
An Era Of Insanity And Darkness In Bloom
Fly! Soar Up Into The Shining Future
To The Day You Become A Legend!
 
No Matter How Many Times You Face Death,
We Accept You Ichiban!
Have Faith And Push On, From Right Where You Are!
Screw It All! You May Have Nothing,
Yet You've Got The Bravery,
To Go Forth And Lead The Wonderful Life! Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah!
